## Computing (Games) Student at Edge Hill University

I am a CS Student studying at [Edge Hill University, Ormskirk](https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/).
I have been a hobbiest programmer since 2016. I am a bit of a data horder and like to collect and manage large amounts of it from images to literature. I have used Linux for years and know the bash terminal very well. I am currently an Intern at a games company based in FL,US as a software developer.

## My Journey
I started programming in Scratch at a very early age learning it in IT classes in High School and then taking it outside the classroom to further develop my understanding of Programming theory. Once I had a good enough understanding I went on to develop little websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Once I had a good enough understanding I started to learn some node.js which then developed into learning some basic Python. I would then use Visual Basic in some College courses as part of some set assignments. I would use Python more religiously when doing work experience, which also developed my love for Linux. The project was to develop a facial recognition device using the [OpenAI](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).  

I started to use Linux more and more, using the various commands built in the bash and some included with package managers. I have used a small amount of Shell Script to automate clearing up files on the Linux system to reduce memory.  

In University I revisited Python as part as my foundation year and learnt some Java. Further in my course I was taught how to use C# and C#/Unity. More information is on my website [here]().
